        <p class="line">
          I know I went wrong. I didn’t understand what you were going through.
          You had so much work… so many responsibilities… and instead of being
          someone who stood with you, I became someone who added more stress.
        </p>
        <p class="line">
          I didn’t fight because I didn’t love you. I fought because I miss you.
          I felt like I wasn’t getting you anymore… and I panicked.
        </p>
        <p class="line">
          The silence wasn’t ego — it was fear. But in those 2 days,
          I ended up hurting the person I love the most. You needed support,
          and I wasn’t there when you needed me. I’m really sorry for that.
